# Desription

This Solution Contains Projects required by Challenge 1 and 3.

The solution Repo can be found on this link : https://github.com/Mogomotsi-Code/Teleamatics.git

## Challenge 1 : Sighting data visualisation

The project requires you to run the SightingData.Api first, Then run the SightingData.Visualizer
once, the two projects are running. The Visualizer app will open a browser showing the heat Map.

There are controls you can use on the map (i.e toogle heatmap, Changing the heat radius etc..) 


## Challenge 2 : Sighting data visualisation

## Challenge 3 : Bluetooth Devices

This Project is written using Xamarin Forms.

It will search for nearby BLE device and display their names/Mac addresses.

Blue tooth functionality  is not supported on the emulator. You need to deploy to a device for testing.

##Challenge 4 :

```bash
    
##  How do you set goals and benchmarks for app development?
    *   I usually break down the requirements into Major functionality vs Minor functionnality.
        I then prioritise major functionality  and set time estimates for each requirement.
            - These may differ depending what the client wants delivered first.
        I usually set the  UI work as low priority, and try to deliver major functionality in incremetes (Usually 2 weeks cycles.)

##  Explain a good life cycle of app development?
    *   A good Software development Life Cycle to me is one that follows each of the following steps
            : Requirements Analysis
            : Design
            : Implementation
            : Testing
            : Evolution
        This is very key in ensuring that the product being developed meets the customer expectations and it's of the right quality.
        This process along with Agile methodolgies, CI/CD approach will ensure that the product is dellivered on time.

##  In your experience what part of the development lifecycle has been the hardest to accomplish? And what has been the easiest?
    * From my experience, the requirements analysis is always the difficult and crutial part of the cycle, as most often, what is put down as requirements is not always what the customer/client had in mind. If this is only discovered later in the cycle, it can cause delays in the delivery of the product.
      The testing phase is in my opinion the easiest as this is mostly concerned with Verification and Validation, So once the product has been developed correctly, The testing phase becomes an easy task to accomplish although this can in some case take long to complete.

## What are some of your favourite technologies and why? (e.g. Git, Docker etc.)
    * My Favourite Technology lately has been Xamarin forms, Reason being it's a cross platform technology therefore allowing you to have a single codebase targeting multiple platforms. This used along with The Azure Devops for CI/CD pipelines.

##  Have you experienced any production issues and how do you handle them? Give an example.
    * Yes I've experinced an issue where during a code merge, there was some functionality that was overriden therfore causing certain parts on of the system to perform incorrectly. This managed to make it's way to production. We then got notified by the client that this functionlaity is not working as it should.
      The solution was to go through the checkin hestory on source control, find the sections of code that were overridden then inclued them, luckly this was not
      lengthy fix, we managed to resolve it with in minutes.
